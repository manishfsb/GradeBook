# GradeBook 

### GradeBook is a small database that helps to track grades of all the students across many courses that a professor is currently teaching.

Written in MySQL using PopSQL(SQL text editor) 

#### How to run the code:

- Download MySQL Community Server(Free) Installer and follow the install instructions.
- Create username and password for MySQL Command Line Client
- Open MySQL Command Line Client and create a database using syntax 'create database database_name'
- Download PopSQL(Free) and link the database you just created. You might be asked to verify your credentials that you previously created for MySQL.
- Now you may copy and paste the code from GradeBook/grade.sql and run whichever query you desire.
- Run a query in PopSQL by hovering over or highlighting the query and click run.
           
The tables have been preloaded with values. If you want to insert your own values, feel free to truncate the table and insert custom values.

A table can be truncated using ' TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;'
